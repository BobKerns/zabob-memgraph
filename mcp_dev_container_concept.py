MCP Development Container Tool Concept

This would be an MCP tool that provides containerized development environments
with project mounts and access to development tools like type checkers, linters, etc.
"""

# Example usage concept:
#
# dev_container_mcp = MCPDevContainer()
#
# # Mount project and run type checking
# result = await dev_container_mcp.run_tool(
#     project_path="/Users/rwk/p/memgraph",
#     tool="mypy",
#     args=["--strict", "memgraph/"]
# )
#
# # Run multiple tools in sequence
# results = await dev_container_mcp.run_pipeline([
#     {"tool": "mypy", "args": ["--strict", "."]},
#     {"tool": "ruff", "args": ["check", "."]},
#     {"tool": "pytest", "args": ["tests/"]},
# ])

Benefits of MCP Dev Container Tool:

1. **Isolated Environments**: Each project gets clean container
2. **Consistent Tooling**: Same Python/tool versions across machines  
3. **Security**: Sandboxed execution of dev tools
4. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple containers for different tools
5. **Tool Discovery**: Container can list available dev tools
6. **Language Support**: Different containers for Python, JS, Rust, etc.

Example Container Images:
- python-dev: mypy, ruff, black, pytest, pylance
- js-dev: eslint, prettier, typescript, jest
- rust-dev: clippy, rustfmt, cargo
- multi-lang: supports multiple languages

MCP Tool Methods:
- list_tools(language): Show available tools for language
- run_tool(project_path, tool, args): Run single tool
- run_pipeline(project_path, tools): Run multiple tools
- get_tool_config(tool): Get default config for tool
- watch_mode(project_path, tools): Continuous monitoring

# This would be incredibly useful for:
# 1. CI/CD-like checks locally
# 2. Consistent dev environments across teams
# 3. Safe execution of untrusted code analysis
# 4. Integration with IDEs via MCP protocol
