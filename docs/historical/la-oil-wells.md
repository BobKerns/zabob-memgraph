## Overview

The Los Angeles Basin has extensive oil well infrastructure, much of it historical but some still active. Understanding this infrastructure is critical to understanding gas storage, subsidence issues, and urban development patterns.

---

## Historical Context

### Oil Boom Era

- [Timeline of LA oil development]
- [Major fields]
- [Economic impact]

### Urban Oil Wells

- Wells operating within city limits
- Wells beneath buildings (e.g., Beverly Center)
- Disguised drilling operations
- [Community relations]

---

## Active Wells

### Current Operations

- [Number of active wells]
- [Production volumes]
- [Operators]

### Regulation and Monitoring

- [Regulatory framework]
- [Safety requirements]
- [Environmental monitoring]

---

## Abandoned/Orphan Wells

### Scale of Problem

- [Number of abandoned wells]
- [Known vs unknown locations]
- [Ownership unclear]

### Risks

- Methane leakage
- Groundwater contamination
- Subsidence
- [Safety hazards]

### Remediation Efforts

- [State programs]
- [Funding]
- [Progress]

## Repurposing for Gas Storage

### Conversion Process

- Original oil wells converted to gas storage
- Geological formations suitable for storage
- Examples: Playa Del Rey, Aliso Canyon

### Technical Considerations

- [Well integrity after conversion]
- [Pressure differences]
- [Age-related risks]

---

## Subsidence Issues

### Historical Subsidence

- [Long Beach area]
- [Other affected areas]
- [Mitigation efforts]

### Current Monitoring

- [Technology]
- [Agencies responsible]

## Notable Locations

### Beverly Center

- [Oil well(s) beneath mall]
- [Operating status]
- [History]

### Other Urban Locations

[To be populated from archive materials]

## Connection to Mulholland Era

William Mulholland's water infrastructure development was contemporaneous with oil boom. Complex interactions between:

- Water rights and oil rights
- Infrastructure placement
- Land development patterns
- [Specific examples]
