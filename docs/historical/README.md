# Bob's Net History

This repository was occasioned by the disappearance the famous "engineering porn" post from its longstanding home. To help preserve it, I have captured it from my archives and added more context and my own musings about history and the importance of connections.

The story you are looking for begins here: [The famous Engineering Pornography post](docs/scattergood-olympic-1989.md).

Don't worry, it's completely suitable for work! It's about an important cable under the streets of Los Angeles. I didn't choose the name, but that's how it has become known.

This threatens to become a dump of my personal history and interests, driven in part by AI eager helpfulness, and my desires for completion and preservation and explanation. I may be OK with this; I think the original audience (including current and future generations) will find parts interesting in a way we found Tom's original narrative interesting. Maybe even argue about it, or even submit PRs with additions or especially corrections.

I *hate* being wrong, so I really appreciate corrections that let me stop being wrong. Because inevitably, I will be wrong some of the time. I have learned to be comfortable with the possibility of being wrong in public; the corrections are often quite illuminating!

Of course, I try not to be wrong in the first place, another motivation for dumping reference materials here that only a few will read. But some will enjoy encountering things they otherwise would not, and it is to these readers that I dedicate this effort.

The [main document](docs/scattergood-olympic-1989.md) is nearly final; mostly I have some better images from Tom, and a bit of cleanup on the flow and connections. The rest is a work in progress.

I hope you enjoy it. Merry Christmas, 2025!

PS: I'm Bob, not ZaBob. ZaBob is the AI assistant I'm building, together with a collection of AI assistants collectively known as Claude Sonnet 4.5 and maybe others. It's a weird journey, and ultimately, becomes part of the story itself.
