# Authorship and Voice

## Mixed Voices by Design

These documents contain multiple voices and authorship styles, which we document transparently:

### Voice Types

1. **Historical Artifacts** - Preserved unchanged from original authors
   - Example: Scattergood-Olympic 1989 narrative by Thomas L. McMahon
   - Voice: Original author's authentic voice from the period
   - Attribution: In document header

2. **Bob Kerns (RWK) - Direct Writing**
   - Sections written directly by Bob
   - Voice: First person or informed technical narrative
   - Often includes personal anecdotes, specific memories

3. **AI-Assisted**
   - Created through collaboration between Bob and AI (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
   - Range of formats:
     - Bob provides prompts/explanations/corrections → AI structures → Bob edits
     - AI asks questions → Bob answers → AI synthesizes → Bob reviews
     - Conversational back-and-forth refined into narrative
   - Bob edits, filters, approves: "Starting with a square wave and filtering it down"
   - Voice: More structured than Bob's natural voice, but content is Bob's knowledge
   - Result combines Bob's expertise with AI's ability to structure and expand

## How to Identify Voice

Documents use metadata blocks where helpful:

```markdown
**Original Author**: [Name]
**Authorship**: [Historical/Direct/AI-assisted]
**Preservation Note**: [Context about the document]
```

For AI-assisted sections, the workflow varies but always involves:

1. Bob provides knowledge, context, direction
2. AI structures and expands
3. Bob edits and filters
4. Result reflects Bob's expertise in clearer form

## Why Mix Voices?

**Preservation**: Historical documents must remain authentic

**Efficiency**: AI assistance accelerates documentation of Bob's knowledge

**Quality**: The editing workflow produces clearer explanations than either alone

**Transparency**: This human-AI collaboration mode is itself historically significant - readers should see how it works

**Historical Significance**: We're documenting not just the past, but a new way of documenting the past. This collaboration between human expertise and AI assistance represents an emerging mode of knowledge capture and transmission.

## Attribution Standards

### For Historical Preservation

- Always preserve original authorship
- Add preservation context in epilogues/metadata
- Clearly separate historical content from modern additions

### For New Content

- **AI-assisted**: Note in document metadata where helpful
- **Direct writing**: No special notation needed (default assumption)
- In most cases, readers can identify voice from context and style
- Transparency matters more for significant sections than for every paragraph

## Voice Transitions

When voice shifts within a document:

- Use clear section breaks (horizontal rules, headings)
- Add metadata if the shift is significant
- Use "Epilogue" or "Modern Notes" for additions to historical artifacts

## The Goal

Make content discoverable, understandable, and attributable while preserving the authentic voices that created it. Whether human-written, AI-assisted, or preserved from history, each voice serves the larger purpose: documenting and preserving connected knowledge.

This transparency also documents an emerging historical phenomenon: the collaboration between human expertise and AI assistance in knowledge capture. Future readers will see not just what we knew, but how we came to document it.
