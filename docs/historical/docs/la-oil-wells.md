# LA Basin Oil Wells - Historical Reference

**Status:** Data dump skeleton
**Purpose:** Reference material on historical and active oil wells in LA Basin
**Related:** [aliso-canyon-history.md](aliso-canyon-history.md), [playa-del-rey-gas-storage.md](playa-del-rey-gas-storage.md)

## Overview

The Los Angeles Basin has extensive oil well infrastructure, much of it historical but some still active. Understanding this infrastructure is critical to understanding gas storage, subsidence issues, and urban development patterns.

---

## Historical Context

### Oil Boom Era

- [Timeline of LA oil development]
- [Major fields]
- [Economic impact]

### Urban Oil Wells

- Wells operating within city limits
- Wells beneath buildings (e.g., Beverly Center, Wright Middle School)
- Disguised drilling operations
- [Community relations]

---

## Active Wells

### Current Operations

- [Number of active wells]
- [Production volumes]
- [Operators]

### Regulation and Monitoring

- [Regulatory framework]
- [Safety requirements]
- [Environmental monitoring]

## Abandoned/Orphan Wells

Let's consider well #0403705859
![alt text](images/well-0403705859-map.png).

This well lies beneath the Wright Middle School. The owner (lease holder and operator) is Sentinel Oil Company.

### Scale of Problem

For context, The well above is literally the first well I clicked on; the first well I spotted on the map with an icon that did not indicate "plugged and abandoned". I did not know it was on school grounds, but it did not surprise me. There was a well on the grounds of my daughter's kindergarten. I picked the first school from a Google Search for "los angeles elementary school". None on the school grounds themselves, but 67 meters away under Obama Blvd, a idle, unplugged well, API 0403705114, owned by Amazon Drilling Corp, listed as idle since 2005. They have two wells, the other is plugged and abandoned. This one lies under a city street.

Wells lie under LAX runways, the upscale Beverley Shopping Center, the dredged entrance to Marina Del Rey.

They sometimes explode (Ross Dress for Less, 1985). They sometimes have blowouts during construction ([MDR Hotels LLC](well-MDR-blowout.pdf))

- [Number of abandoned wells]
- [Known vs unknown locations]
- [Ownership unclear]

### Risks

- Methane leakage
- Groundwater contamination
- Subsidence
- [Safety hazards]

### Remediation Efforts

- [State programs]
- [Funding]
- [Progress]

## Repurposing for Gas Storage

### Conversion Process

- Original oil wells converted to gas storage
- Geological formations suitable for storage
- Examples: Playa Del Rey, Aliso Canyon

### Technical Considerations

- [Well integrity after conversion]
- [Pressure differences]
- [Age-related risks]

---

## Subsidence Issues

### Historical Subsidence

- [Long Beach area]
- [Other affected areas]
- [Mitigation efforts]

### Current Monitoring

- [Technology]
- [Agencies responsible]

---

## Notable Locations

### Beverly Center

- [Oil well(s) beneath mall]
- [Operating status]
- [History]

### Other Urban Locations

[To be populated from archive materials]

## Connection to Mulholland Era

William Mulholland's water infrastructure development was contemporaneous with oil boom. Complex interactions between:

- Water rights and oil rights
- Infrastructure placement
- Land development patterns
- [Specific examples]
