## Scattergood-Olympic Cable History

### Original Installation (1972)

- 230KV, 10-mile oil-filled cable
- Three-phase, 600-800 amps per phase
- 2000-foot segments with underground vaults
- Golden Bear High Tension Oil (100K gallons)
- Santa Monica Bay ground return

### 1989 Failure and Repair

See [scattergood-olympic-1989.md](scattergood-olympic-1989.md) for detailed narrative.

Key technical details:

- **Root cause:** TMB (Thermal Mechanical Bending)
- **Duration:** [From LADWP docs]
- **Cost:** $75M estimated (8 months downtime at $13K/hour)
- **Repair method:** Liquid nitrogen freeze plugs, 17 splice collar installations

### 2018 Replacement

- **Technology:** Modern polyethylene insulation
- **Original line status:** Kept as backup
- **Project details:** [From LADWP documentation]
- **Contractor:** [From press releases if available]
- **Timeline:** [From archive materials]

### Physical Artifacts

- **Cable cross-section sample:** In Bob Kerns' collection
  - Shows polyethylene vs oil-filled design
  - [Dimensions, construction details visible]

## El Segundo Power Center

### Ownership and Operation

- **Operator:** Private LLC
- **Grid connection:** Southern California Edison (not LADWP)
- **Location:** Immediately south of Scattergood

### Technology

- **Configuration:** Two CCGT (Combined Cycle Gas Turbine) systems
- **Gas turbines:** Siemens SGT6-5000F
  - Fast-start capability
  - Air-cooled design
- **Steam turbines:** [Details if available]
  - Often overlooked in CCGT discussions
  - Critical to combined cycle efficiency

### Significance

- Physical proximity to Scattergood illustrates parallel grid infrastructure
- Different ownership/grid connection demonstrates complexity of LA power landscape
- [Capacity comparison with Scattergood if available]

---

## Environmental Context

### El Segundo Blue Butterfly

- Habitat: El Segundo dunes
- Threats: LAX expansion, oceanside housing development
- Broader ecological context: Ice plant invasion, dune ecosystem preservation
- [Conservation status, efforts]
  - at one point, it was slated for an upscale ocean housing development; hence the presence of "streets".
  - Ice plant displacing their narrow habitat
  - New populations

### Chevron El Segundo Refinery

- Adjacent facility to Scattergood
- [Relationship, if any, to power/gas infrastructure]

### Santa Monica Bay

- Ground return for both Scattergood cable and Pacific Intertie
- [Environmental considerations]
- [Copper anchor details from original story]

## 2024 Scattergood Modernization

From Tom McMahon's 2024 letter:

- Units 1 & 2 modernization plans
- Hydrogen capability transition
- [Details from letter]
- [Policy/regulatory context]

Connection to broader energy transition:

- [Context from archive materials]
- [Relationship to gas storage, renewables, grid stability]

- Connectivity matters more than geographic distance
- [Examples from LA grid]

### Supply Chain Perspectives

- Electrical transmission
- Gas supply
- [Other infrastructure dependencies]

## Notes

This document serves as a repository for detailed reference material that would overwhelm the focused narrative in scattergood-olympic-1989.md. The knowledge graph connects these materials and allows exploration of relationships without forcing every detail into a linear document.

**Restraint principle:** Not every connection needs to be followed in prose - the graph holds those relationships for those who want to explore them.
