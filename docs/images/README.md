# Zabob Memgraph Banner Images

This directory contains miscellaneous banner images for the Zabob Memgraph project.

Most image assets are in [.dev/library/docs-assets/images](.dev/library/docs-assets/images), to facilitate sharing with other Zabob projects.

## Required Images

Based on the Zabob project structure, we need:

1. **zabob-banner-memory.jpg** - Main banner for README files

   - Should follow the visual style of [.dev-library/docs-assets/images/zabob-holodeck.jpg](.dev-library/docs-assets/images/zabob-holodeck.jpg)
   - Incorporate knowledge graph/network visualization themes
   - Include "Zabob Memgraph" branding
   - Recommended size: Similar to zabob-banner.jpg (~600KB)

2. **zabob-banner.jpg** - Compact banner for documentation pages

   - Should follow the visual style of [.dev-library/docs-assets/images/zabob-banner.jpg](.dev-library/docs-assets/images/zabob-banner.jpg)
   - More compact layout suitable for doc pages
   - Include "Zabob Memgraph" text overlay
   - Knowledge graph visualization theme

## Visual Theme Ideas

For Zabob Memgraph banners, consider incorporating:

- Network/graph visualization elements (nodes and connections)
- Neural network or brain-inspired imagery
- Data visualization aesthetics
- Consistent with Zabob's futuristic/AI theme
- Color scheme that complements the main Zabob branding
- "Knowledge Graph" or "Memory Network" visual metaphors

## Current Status

Updated images have been supplied. Text on the holodeck hero image reads "AI Memory / Part of the Zabob Universe / Remembering the future / (so you don't have to)", in decreasing size. The banner images text reads "AI Memory", in italics. Both include bold "Zabob" on the left, next to his portrait.

The backgrounds in each are variations of the same alien city scene with dramatic clouds brilliantly lit by an alien sun, from deep blues to vivid crimson.
